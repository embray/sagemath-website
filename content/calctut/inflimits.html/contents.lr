  <p>
  Limits at infinity truly are not so difficult once you've become familiarized
  with then, but at first, they may seem somewhat obscure. The basic premise
  of limits at infinity is that many functions approach a specific y-value as
  their independent variable becomes increasingly large or small. We're going to
  look at a few different functions as their independent variable approaches
  infinity, so start a new worksheet called 04-Limits at Infinity, then recreate
  the following graph.
  </p>
  <div class="proof">

  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
plot(1/(x-3), x, -100, 100, randomize=False, plot_points=10001) \
    .show(xmin=-10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, ymax=10)
</pre>

  1-2) Plot 1/(x-3) from -100 to 100. The backslash indicates that the command
  continues on the second line. Not randomizing the points on the graph produces
  a consistently smoother result, and plot_points=10001 is simply so that {{ sage }} won't
  draw a line for the vertical asymptote at x=3. Though the graph was plotted from
  -100 to 100, it is only shown for a domain and range of -10 to 10.
  </p>
  <p>
  In this graph, it is fairly easy to see that as x becomes increasingly large or
  increasingly small, the y-value of f(x) becomes very close to zero, though it
  never truly <em>does</em> equal zero. When a function's curve suggests an invisible
  line at a certain y-value (such as at y=0 in this graph), it is said to have a <strong>
  horizontal asymptote</strong> at that y-value. We can use limits to describe the
  behavior of the horizontal asymptote in this graph, as:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits02.png" class="vmiddle" /> and <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits03.png" class="vmiddle" />
  </div>
  <p>
  Try setting xmin as -100 and xmax as 100, and you will see that f(x) becomes very
  close to zero indeed when x is very large or very small. Which is what you should
  expect, since one divided by a large number will naturally produce a small result.
  </p>
  <p>
  The concept of one-sided limits can be applied to the vertical asymptote in this
  example, since one can see that as x approaches 3 from the left, the function
  approaches negative infinity, and that as x approaches 3 from the right, the
  function approaches positive infinity, or:

  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits04.png" class="vmiddle" /> and <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits05.png" class="vmiddle" />
  </div>
  <p>
  Unfortunately, the behavior of functions as x approaches positive or negative
  infinity is not always so easy to describe. If ever you run into a case where
  you can't discern a function's behavior at infinity--whether a graph isn't
  available or isn't very clear--imagining what sort of values would be produced
  when ten-thousand or one-hundred thousand is substituted for x will normally
  give you a good indication of what the function does as x approaches infinity.
  </p>
  <h2>Powers and Exceptions</h2>
  <p>
  Let's analyze a couple of not-so-straightforward examples concerning limits at
  infinity to ensure a full understanding of how they work. Take a look at this
  strangely bird-like function:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits06.png" />
  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
plot((2*x^4 + x^2 + 2)/(x^4 + 1), x, -4, 4).show(xmin=-3, xmax=3, ymin=-1, ymax=2.5)
</pre>
<a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  The graph gives it away; the limit of the function as x approaches either positive
  or negative infinity is two. But what if we didn't have the graph? There are
  actually a couple of clues as to what value the function approaches at both
  infinities. Compare the numerator to the denominator: see how the "highest power"
  of each polynomial is 4? The numerator has 2*x<sup>4</sup> and the denominator has simply
  x<sup>4</sup>. Perhaps you see where this is going--what do you get when you divide 2*x<sup>4</sup>
  by x<sup>4</sup>? Why, 2 of course. Simply put, when the numerator and the denominator of
  a function have the same power--when the highest exponents of x between the top
  and bottom of the fraction match--the function will have a horizontal asymptote
  at y equals (coefficient of numerator's highest power) / (coefficient of denominator's
  highest power).
  </p>
  <p>
  Well...maybe that wasn't so simple. Let me reiterate with a general case. For
  a function like this one:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits07.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  Assuming that n is the highest exponent of both the numerator and denominator
  and that a and b are coefficients:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits08.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  For this trick to work, though, the function <em>must</em> be a rational expression
  (one polynomial divided by another) and cannot have trigonometric or other
  special functions in the numerator or denominator. For example, the horizontal
  asymptote of the following function cannot be found using the above method, as it
  refers to an expression where x is an exponent.
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits09.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  Before you graph this function to see if and where it has a horizontal asymptote,
  though, let us try a bit of logical analysis. First, which will grow the fastest,
  e^x or 5^x? Evaluating 'float(e)' in {{ sage }} will tell you that Euler's number e
  equals approximately 2.7182818284590451, so 5^x will grow more quickly than e^x. But what
  about the 2*x in the denominator? Consider the growth, now, of 5^x relative to
  2*x. When x is 5, the former evaluates to 3125 while the latter evaluates to 10.
  What you should gather from this is that 5^x trumps all; as x approaches positive
  or negative infinity, the function will become the quotient of a big number (e^x)
  divided by a <em>really</em> big number that only continues to grow. In other words,
  one could write this as:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits10.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  And tada! There you have it. Comparing relative growths is another way of figuring
  out the behavior of a function as its independent variable approaches infinity.

  oscillate.

  <h2>Oscillating Functions</h2>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits11.png" />
  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
plot(sin(x), x, -10, 10)
</pre>
<a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  Like most of the trigonometric functions, as x approaches positive or negative
  infinity, the sine function itself continues to jump up and down. An <strong>
  oscillating function</strong> is one that continues to move between two or more
  values as its independent variable (x) approaches positive or negative infinity.
  The limit of an oscillating function f(x) as x approaches positive or negative
  infinity is undefined. In the plot that you just created, try replacing 'sin'
  with various other trigonometric functions such as 'cos', 'tan', 'sec', 'csc',
  'cot', or any of the arc-functions (like 'arctan') to observe whether they
  oscillate or whether they have a horizontal asymptote as x approaches positive
  or negative infinity.
  </p>
  <p>
  The next graph behaves differently though, as you may observe:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits12.png" />
  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
plot(sin(x)/x, x, -100, 100).show(ymin=-1)
</pre>
<a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  Even though the function oscillates indefinitely due to the sine function in
  its numerator, I can tell you without a doubt that the limit of the function as
  x approaches either positive or negative infinity is still zero. But why is this?
  The sine of a really big number must still be somewhere in the range of -1 and 1,
  while denominator will simply be a really big number. If we create a
  table of values, we can watch the function's behavior when x is large. Use the
  following code to create such a table.
  </p>
<pre class="tutcode">
def f(x):
    return sin(x) / x

def table():
    print '|   x   |   f(x)    |'
    print '|-------------------|'
    for x in [10000..10010]:
        print '|%6i | %+f |'%(x, f(x))

table()
</pre>

  <p class="tutexplain" id="explain2">
  1-2) Define a function f(x) that is equal to sin(x)/x. The 'def f(x):' signifies
  "when f(x) is referenced, do whatever the next indented line says".<br />
  4) Define a function called 'table'<br />
  5-6) Print the header of the table.<br />
  7) Starting at x=10000, perform the following indented command, incrementing x
  by 1 every time.<br />
  8) Print the current values of x and f(x). '%6i' means "fill six spaces with the
  following integer", while '%+f' means "put a positive or negative sign in front
  of the following floating point number". The '%(x, f(x))' at the end of the line
  tells {{ sage }} which numbers to use when it replaces the preceding percentage signs.
  </p>
  <p>
  There is another way to prove that the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches positive
  or negative infinity is zero. Whether you have heard of it as the pinching theorem,
  the sandwich theorem or the <strong>squeeze theorem</strong>, as I will refer
  to it here, the squeeze theorem says that for three functions g(x), f(x), and
  h(x),
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  If <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits13.png" class="vmiddle" /> and
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits14.png" class="vmiddle" />,<br />
  then <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits15.png" class="vmiddle" />.
  </div>
  <p>
  To apply this theorem, we have to find a function g(x) that is less than f(x)
  as well as a function h(x) that is greater than f(x). Since sin(x) is always
  somewhere in the range of -1 and 1, we can set g(x) equal to -1/x and h(x)
  equal to 1/x. We know that the limit of both -1/x and 1/x as x approaches either
  positive or negative infinity is zero, therefore the limit of sin(x)/x as x
  approaches either positive or negative infinity is zero. One could write this
  out as:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  Given that <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits16.png" class="vmiddle" /> and
  <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits17.png" class="vmiddle" />,<br />
  since&nbsp;<img src="calctut-pix/inflimits18.png" class="vmiddle" />&nbsp;
  for all x in &nbsp;<img src="calctut-pix/inflimits19.png" class="vmiddle" />
  and <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits20.png" class="vmiddle" />,<br />
  it follows that <img src="calctut-pix/inflimits21.png" class="vmiddle" />.
