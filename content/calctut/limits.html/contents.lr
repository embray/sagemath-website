  Before we discuss exactly what a limit is, let's take a moment to become
  familiarized with the {{ sage }} Notebook, which you will be using throughout these
  lessons. Assuming that you have the Notebook open, go ahead and create a new
  worksheet. Our work for each section will be kept in its own separate worksheet,
  which will make it easier to find and review past exercises. Click on File...
  Rename, and in the dialog box that pops up, call the worksheet 01-Limits.

  <p>
  A limit, to be concise, is the value that a function approaches as a
  variable (such as x) approaches a certain value. Most of the time, this is
  fairly straightforward. For a function f(x) = 2*x, for example, the limit of f(x)
  as x approaches 4 would simply be 8, since 2 times 4 is 8. The notation for
  this, as you will surely see in a calculus book, in a calculus classroom or
  on a calculus test, looks like:

  Where limits will come in handy, though, is in situations where there is some
  ambiguity as to the value of a function at a point. As an example of this
  ambiguity, let's look at the graph of f(x) = (x<sup>2</sup> - 1)/(x - 1). In the first cell
  of your worksheet, copy the following code, then press SHIFT-ENTER or click on
  "evaluate".
  </p>
<pre class="tutcode">
p = plot((x^2 - 1)/(x - 1), x, -1, 3)
pt = point((1, 2), rgbcolor='white', pointsize=30, faceted=True)
g = p+pt
g.show(xmin=0, xmax=3, ymin=0, ymax=4)
</pre>

  <p class="tutexplain" id="explain1">
   Here is a breakdown of what the code does:<br />
   1) Create a plot of our function using variable 'x' on the domain -1 &lt; x &lt; 3.<br />
   2) Create an open (faceted) point at (1, 2), with a 'white' interior and the given point size.<br />
   3) Combine the plot and the point (the plus sign indicates 'combine these elements').<br />
   4) Show the combined plot and the point, using the given x and y bounds (similar to
   a graphing calculator).
  </p>
  <p>
  The graph that appears should look something like this:
  </p>

  <p>
  Looking at f(x), one can see that setting x equal to 1 would make both the
  numerator and the denominator equal to zero, which is why there is a circle
  at that point on the graph. Even though f(1) is undefined, however, we can
  still analyze, by way of limits, what f(1) would equal if it
  <em>did</em> exist. The notation for this would be:
  </p>
  <img src="calctut-pix/limits03.png" />
  <p>
  Just by looking at the graph, one can see that as x approaches 1, the y-value for
  f(x) approaches 2. To find this value algebraically, we can <strong>remove the
  discontinuity</strong> by factoring the numerator, then dividing both the top
  and the bottom by (x - 1) to obtain:
  </p>
  <img src="calctut-pix/limits04.png" />
  <p>
  Thus, both graphically and analytically, we can see that the limit of f(x) as
  x approaches 1 is equal to 2. To verify this result, we can actually use the
  following code to have {{ sage }} compute the limit for us:
  </p>
<pre class="tutcode">
limit((x^2 - 1)/(x - 1), x=1)
</pre>
  <a class="tuttoggle" href="javascript:calctut.toggle(2);">Toggle Explanation</a> <a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p class="tutexplain" id="explain2">
   1) Evaluate the limit of (x<sup>2</sup> - 1)/(x - 1) as x approaches 1 (designated by 'x=1').
  </p>
  <p>
  Copying the code into an empty cell of your worksheet and evaluating it will
  verify the result. You can use the limit function to check your answers to
  the following practice problems, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
  On your own, now, try evaluating the following three limits first graphically,
  then by algebraic simplification. To aid this pursuit, I have included {{ sage }} code
  to plot the first two functions, though it won't circle the discontinuities
  for you this time. Simply copy the code for each into a new cell on your
  worksheet and evaluate it. For the last three, see if you can manipulate the code
  from one of the other examples to graph the function. On a sidenote, use "pi"
  without the quotes to reference &pi; from {{ sage }}.
