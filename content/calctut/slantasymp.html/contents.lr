  Depending on whether your calculus class covers this topic or not, you may wish
  to pass by this mini-section. If you find asymptotes interesting, though...keep
  on reading! You'll want to start a new worksheet called 05-Slant Asymptotes before
  you proceed with the rest of this section.

  So far, we have looked at the behavior of two types of functions as x approaches
  positive or negative infinity: those with horizontal asymptotes, and those that
  oscillate indefinitely. The third type we are going to cover is <strong>slant
  asymptotes</strong>. Also known as <strong>oblique asymptotes</strong>, 
  slant asymptotes are invisible, diagonal lines suggested by a function's curve
  that approach a certain slope as x approaches positive or negative infinity.
  The following graph is one such function:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/slantasymp01.png" />
  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
plot((x^2-3*x-4)/(x-2), x, -10, 10, randomize=False, plot_points=101).show(ymin=-20, ymax=20)
</pre>
<a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  It looks like f(x) starts to approach a certain slope rather than a certain
  y-value to both sides of the vertical asymptote. As in the last section, this
  function gives the suggestion of an invisible line separating the top and bottom
  portions of the graph. In this case, the invisible line is a slant asymptote.
  The question here is not of which value the function approaches, but of which
  slope it approaches as x becomes increasingly large or small. To answer this
  question, let's do a little numerical analysis. Copy, paste, then evaluate the
  following code.
  </p>
<pre class="tutcode">
def f(x):
    return (x^2-3*x-4)/(x-2)

for i in [4..100]:
    print f(float(i))-f(float(i-1))
</pre>

  <p class="tutexplain" id="explain1">
  1-2) Define the function f(x) as the rational expression (x<sup>2</sup>-3*x-4)/(x-2)<br />
  4-5) Loop from i equal 4 to i equals 100, printing out the slope between f(i)
  and f(i-1) for each value of i. 'float' is so that {{ sage }} displays the slope
  as a decimal and not as a fraction.<br /><br />
  If the above code still seems untowardly foreign...try playing around with it!
  In my experience, going hands-on with code is often the best way to understand
  what it does.
  </p>
  <p>
  Based on the code's output, we can see that in the area of x=100, the function's
  slope is approximately equal to 1. Using {{ sage }}'s 'limit' function, we can confirm
  this result:
  </p>
<pre class="tutcode">
limit(f(x)-f(x-1), x=oo)
</pre>
<a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  As expected, the limit of the function's slope as x approaches infinity is 1. A
  hunch would tell you that the function's slope as x approaches negative infinity
  is most likely 1 as well, and changing the x=oo to x=-oo verifies that result.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now that you've done things the hard way, though, I'll tell you a shortcut to
  find the slope of slant asymptotes for rational functions. For a generalized
  rational function like this one:
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/slantasymp02.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  If n is the highest power of the denominator, n+1 is the highest power of the
  numerator, and a and b are constants, the function will have a horizontal
  asymptote with a slope equal to a/b. You will find that slant asymptotes only
  pop up when the numerator of a function is of one higher power than the denominator
  of a rational function. Where numerical analysis can still come into play,
  though, in a case where you can't simplify a function to fit this general form.
