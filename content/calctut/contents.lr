  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
  Welcome to the {{ sage }} Calculus Tutorial! From initial concepts to increasingly
  complex techniques and applications, this tutorial is meant to accompany a high
  school- or college-level beginning calculus course. You'll learn how to interact
  with the incredibly robust, yet free and open-source, {{ sage }} Computer Algebra
  System.
  </p>
  <p>
  No previous experience with {{ sage }} or calculus is necessary, though you will
  need to either <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/download.html">download {{ sage }}</a> or
  <a href="https://cocalc.com/?utm_source=sagemath.org&amp;utm_medium=calctut">work online at CoCalc</a>
  in order to participate actively in the following lessons.
<div style="border: 2px solid #c9c9f9; border-radius: 5px; overflow: hidden; margin: 10px 0px; padding: 5px 10px;">

  <div>
  In particular, there are prepared versions of these lessons as executable worksheets right on
  <a href="https://cocalc.com/?utm_source=sagemath.org&amp;utm_medium=calctut">CoCalc</a>!
  First, create an account and a project.
  Then you can get a copy of the files
  <a href="https://cocalc.com/projects/487587b1-8b24-401a-92d9-a9b930edd53d/files/?utm_source=sagemath.org&amp;utm_medium=calctut">from here</a>!

  If you know little or nothing
  about writing code - don't despair! Below most code snippets you will find a
  blue "Toggle Explanation" link, which when clicked will explain line-by-line how
  the code works. If you would first like to brush up on some pre-calculus and
  trigonometry concepts, <a href="review.html">this review</a> may be of help. To

  If the tutorial's text is difficult to read, try zooming in or out using your
  browser's shortcuts. In Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 1.0-3.x, pressing CTRL
  then + will zoom in, while pressing CTRL then - will zoom out. If your browser
  does not include such a feature, use the + and - keys to increase or decrease
  the font size from any page in the tutorial.
