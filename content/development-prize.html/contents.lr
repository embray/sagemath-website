<h2 class="narrow">2012 Spies Prize: Jason Grout</h2>

<div class="narrow">
<strong>Jason Grout</strong> is a constant presence across the
{{ sage }} landscape.  He is extremely active in the discussion groups, comments on
many tickets, contributes code to the core {{ sage }} library, improves the
documentation, and works tirelessly to improve the notebook interface.  He
contributes in many ways to make {{ sage }} a better tool for mathematics
research, but he is perhaps most recognized for his efforts to make
{{ sage }} an effective tool for teaching mathematics.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
Jason's mathematical tastes have resulted in major code contributions
for linear algebra, graph theory, plotting and symbolics.  These are
all important areas for the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.  But
he is equally interested in {{ sage }} infrastructure, such as LaTeX
representation, usability improvements to Trac server, format and
delivery of documentation, and NumPy/SciPy integration.  With a strong
background in web applications, his work on the notebook interface is
both visionary and technically strong.  A recent project he runs is
the {{ sage }} Cell Server, which allows a remote server to accept {{ sage }} code
and return results without any account or login.  This can power
interactive demonstrations on web pages or computations via mobile
devices, and the principles and implementations will be used in
increasing the scalability of {{ sage }} servers.  As an example of his
interest in education, this project has involved several undergraduate
students in significant ways.  Jason also gives freely of his time to
help other users and developers.  He is the second most numerous
poster of all time in the sage-support forum, in the top five for the
sage-devel, sage-edu and sage-notebook forums, and he has the
fifth-highest karma at the Ask {{ sage }} site.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his significant and inspiring technical contributions, his massive
contributions to the vitality of the {{ sage }} community, his work on
making {{ sage }} available via the notebook and cell servers, and his
interest in education, Jason Grout is awarded the 2012 Spies {{ sage }}
Development Prize. This award carries a prize of $500 from the {{ sage }}
Foundation (thanks to Jaap Spies).

<strong>Robert Bradshaw</strong> has been an extremely active and productive {{ sage }}
developer for over five years.  Additionally, he has been a leader,
both in maintaining the community and in important design decisions.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
He is probably best known for his work on Cython, which is critical for
the performance of many key parts of {{ sage }}, and his work designing and
implementing the coercion model, which makes many powerful
mathematical constructions possible. However, his interests and
significant contributions are wide-ranging, including: exact linear
algebra, arithmetic of elliptic curves, L-functions, 3-D plotting and
parallel building.  A recent project is the patchbot tool, which
automates testing contributions posted on trac.  Moreover, he is an
important contributor to trouble-shooting and design discussions in
the sage-devel forum and is also the third most numerous poster of all
time in the sage-support forum.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his many important technical contributions, and his long-time and
continuing involvement in the {{ sage }} community, Robert Bradshaw is
