 <h2 class="narrow">Usage</h2>

 <div class="txt narrow">
The Solaris binaries are compressed and are available in two forms. If your SPARC system has the 'p7zip' command, which is standard on recent Solaris 10 releases, then it is recommended you download sage-...tar.7z as it is considerably smaller than the gzip compressed file. Otherwise you can download the .gz file, build pk7zip yourself, or install Sun patch 137477.

<pre>
$ p7zip -d sage-....tar.7z (if you used the recommended .7z file) 
$ gzip -d sage-....tar.gz (if you downloaded the larger .gz file)
</pre>

Sun's version of tar will not extract the binaries, so use the GNU tar.

<pre>
$ /usr/sfw/bin/gtar xf sage-..tar 
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/sfw/lib 
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
Change to the directory where the files were extracted, then run
<pre>
$ ./sage 
</pre>
